## Release Notes

### Version 1.0.0

This is the first stable release of Go Micro Framework. This release includes:

- **Complete Framework**: Full-featured framework for microservices development
- **Library Integration**: Seamless integration with all 20+ libraries from [go-micro-libs](https://github.com/anasamu/go-micro-libs/)
- **CLI Tool**: Comprehensive command-line interface for service management
- **Service Generation**: Generate production-ready microservices with a single command
- **Deployment Ready**: Built-in support for Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud deployment
- **Production Features**: Monitoring, logging, security, and resilience built-in

### Key Features

1. **Zero-Configuration Setup**: Framework handles all default configurations
2. **Business Logic Focus**: Developers focus on business logic, not infrastructure
3. **Production Ready**: Built-in monitoring, logging, security, and resilience
4. **Extensible**: Easy to add new features and custom providers
